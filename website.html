  <h1>How to create your own website!</h1>
  <p>First you must download any code editor my favorite is called Atom.
    After downloading a code editor I recommend heading over to
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">w3schools HTML Intro</a>
    this is a really good resource to read what HTML is and how it works.
    Once you have an understanding of HTML you are ready to start coding your own website!
    To begin you must first know what topic your website will be about.
    This will make it a lot more easier to create content for your website.
    The last thing you would want is to have no idea on what to write, but it
    happens all the time as a coder you will get stuck from time to time!
    <br>
    <br>
    Once you have a topic in mind we are gonna start with the HTML <em>"Boilerplate"</em> code.
    Now inside the title you will want to put what your topic is about. Next we will
    start adding the <strong>H1 Heading</strong> to the body code it can be anything
    related to your topic! <em>Optional:You can also add a
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp">horizontal line</a> after your heading.</em>
