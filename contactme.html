<h1>How to create a Contact us!</h1>

<body>
  <p>There are multiple ways you can create a contact us using html. I recommend
    using a seperate .html file located within your website to bring the user
    to another page. In order to do this you must create a new file within
    your websites folder. Once you have done that you must now use your html
    Boilerplate and start by making a h1 heading for contact us!
    Now in the body you must make a paragraph for each contact information.
    Here is an example: </p>
  <br>
  <p>123 my fake address LA, California 90001</p>
  <p>+1-(222)-345-6789</p>
  <p>myfakemail@gmail.com</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you want to create a form on your html contact us website you
    can do this also! Start with the form Boilerplate and then add your first
    label. Inside the label can be anything, but for a contact us page you will
    want to put Your Name: After this you will add an input and by default it will
    be a text box, but you can change this to a lot of different attributes. To find
    examples you can go to this <a href="https://devdocs.io/html/element/input">link</a>.
    Here is an example of a form made for your html website:</p>
  <form class="" action="mailto:myfakemail@gmail.com" method="post">
    <label>Your Name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="" value=""><br>
    <label>Your Email:</label>
    <input type="email" name="" value=""><br>
    <label>Subject:</label>
    <textarea name="name" rows="3" cols="30"></textarea><br>
    <label>Would You Like To Sign Up For Our Emails?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="" value="">
    <input type="submit" name="">
  </form>
</body>

</html>
